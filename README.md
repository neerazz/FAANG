# Competitive Programming

The repository contains solutions to various coding Competitive Programming sites like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/neerazz90/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/b_neerajkumarsi1)
, [Hackearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/@neerajkumarsingh), [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/dashboard#/), AlgoExpert
& [EPI](https://github.com/neerazz/FAANG/blob/master/Resources/Elements%20of%20Programming%20Interviews%20in%20Java.pdf)
. I've tried to provide the detailed solution and the intuition through comments.

These questions are classical problems that are most frequently asked by the tech giants in technical interviews and are
not related to hard core competitive coding.

## [Important Links](https://github.com/neerazz/FAANG/blob/master/ImportantLinks.md#hacking-software-engineering-interviews)

## How to contribute?

1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When to contribute?

1. If there is no solution to a problem.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size it would be better to, comment out the
   original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
