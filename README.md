# FAANG, the Magnificent Seven & Modern Tech Interviews (2025)

> **Note:** While the term "FAANG" (Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) is still widely recognized, the tech world in 2025 often refers to the "Magnificent Seven" (Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla) as the dominant group of companies shaping the industry and interview trends. This repository keeps the FAANG name for legacy and recognition, but covers all major tech interview patterns.

Welcome! This repository is a comprehensive collection of solutions, explanations, and resources for mastering coding interviews at top tech companies. Whether you're preparing for interviews at FAANG, the Magnificent Seven, or any leading tech firm, you'll find:

- **Original, well-commented solutions** to hundreds of classic and trending problems
- **Intuitive explanations** and step-by-step approaches
- **Curated resources** for Data Structures, Algorithms, System Design, and OOP
- **Company-specific and topic-specific question lists**

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

Tech interviews are evolving, but the fundamentals remain the same. The problems here are the backbone of interviews at companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, and more. Mastering these will prepare you for both traditional and modern interview formats.

## [Complexities & Big O Explained](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/)
Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for writing efficient code and acing interviews. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview:

| Complexity Type | Notation   | Example Algorithm                | Typical Use Case             |
|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Constant        | O(1)       | Hash table lookup                | Accessing array element      |
| Logarithmic     | O(log n)   | Binary search                    | Searching in sorted array    |
| Linearithmic    | O(n log n) | Merge sort, Heap sort            | Efficient sorting            |
| Quadratic       | O(n^2)     | Bubble sort, Selection sort      | Simple nested loops          |
| Cubic           | O(n^3)     | Floyd-Warshall, 3-nested loops   | Some DP, matrix operations   |
| Factorial       | O(n!)      | Traveling Salesman, permutations | Brute-force combinatorics    |

- Always clarify which case youâ€™re analyzing in interviews.
- Amortized analysis (e.g., dynamic array resizing) is also common.
**Why Big O?**
Big O notation helps you compare algorithms and predict performance as input size grows. Interviewers expect you to:
- Optimize when possible
- Justify trade-offs
