## Arrays & Strings

1. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use
   additional data structures? - IsUniqueString
2. Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
3. URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string has sufficient
   space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: If
   implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
   EXAMPLE Input: "Mr John Smith " J 13 Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"
